# JavaScript-Projects
Hello, my name is Shirley and I am UX/UI Designer student at the Tech Academy in Portland, OR.
These are Javascript projects from various assignments from basic functions, and slideshows. 
Please check out my HTML and CSS Portfolio for more.

Here are a few main projects I've worked on:

<b>Tic Tac Toe</b>
This is Tic Tac Toe with a twist; cats! It is player vs. computer with cat meows on each turn to keep the game alive.

<b>Pizza Menu</b>
This is an online pizza menu that allows you to select various toppings and view total due.

<b>Calculator</b>
This is a fully functioning basic calculator.
