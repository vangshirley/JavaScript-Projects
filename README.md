# JavaScript-Projects
Hello, my name is Shirley and I am UX/UI Designer student at the Tech Academy in Portland, OR.
These are Javascript projects from various assignments including, but not limited to basic functions, slideshows and effects. 
Please check out my HTML and CSS Portfolio for more.

Here are a few main projects I've worked on:

<b>Tic Tac Toe</b>
